# RandomWalk
An implementation of a loop erased random walk (*LERW*) in python

To consider:
  1. Statistics of enclosed area between bidirectional LERWs
  2. Statistics of the area
  3. Statistics of intersections
  4. Average distribution/variance of the number of intersections
  5. Average eccentricity of ellipse

TO DO:
  1. Modulerise code to generate random walk based on args(system size, number of realisations)
  2. Get more statistics for horizontal displacement (gen more realisations)
  3. Plot size distribution on double logarithmic (scales) plot
  4. Find ratio of number of intersections to total coordinates for many realizations and different system sizes
  5. Misc
    a. Find the mechanics of the brackets ([:] vs. deepcopy)
