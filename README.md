# Random Walks
An implementation of random walks (*RW*) and loop erased random walks (*LERW*) in Python. This is the code produced for the research on the statistics of random walks, particularly loop erased random walks, conducted by Habib Rehman (@HR) and Dr. Gunnar Pruessner (g.pruessner@imperial.ac.uk) of the Imperial College London.

To consider:
  1. Statistics of enclosed area between bidirectional LERWs
  2. Statistics of the area
  3. Statistics of intersections
  4. Average distribution/variance of the number of intersections
  5. Average eccentricity of ellipse
