# RandomWalk
An implementation of a loop erased random walk (*LERW*) in python

To consider:
  1. Statistics of enclosed area between bidirectional LERWs
  2. Statistics of the area
  3. Statistics of intersections
  4. Average distribution/variance of the number of intersections
  5. Average eccentricity of ellipse

The code used on the Statistics of Random Walks research. This is the code produced for the research on the statistics of random walks, particularly loop erased random walks, conducted by Habib Rehman (@HR) and Dr. Gunnar Pruessner (g.pruessner@imperial.ac.uk) of the Imperial College London.
